This project is done using matlab 2017b
please run the main.m script for solving montecarlo simulation of Element BD
               pure_displacement.m script for only displacement using FEM method 
               Echange_2elem.m script for montecarlo simulation of 2 elements BD and AB
simulation time for the D_problem.m is 15-20s,
also please make sure that all 5 functions and 3 script file is in the same folder.
the E changes with normal distribution
